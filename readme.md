# K-Means Clustering Analysis

This repository contains the source code and resources for the **K-Means Clustering Analysis** project. The project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering for unsupervised machine learning, focusing on the selection of the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method and silhouette score analysis.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The synthetic dataset is generated using the `make_blobs` function from `scikit-learn`, which provides a simple way to create datasets with a known structure.
   - The dataset is then standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering algorithm.

2. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - **Elbow Method**: The elbow method is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters (`k`). The "elbow" point on the plot indicates the number of clusters beyond which there is no significant decrease in WCSS.
   - **Silhouette Analysis**: Silhouette coefficients are calculated for different values of `k`. The silhouette score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher score indicates that the object is well-matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.

3. **Visualization**:
   - The elbow curve is plotted to visualize WCSS against the number of clusters, helping to identify the optimal number of clusters.
   - A plot of silhouette coefficients is created to assess the quality of the clustering for different values of `k`.

## Project Structure

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the Jupyter notebook:

``` bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

## Usage

Imports

The notebook begins by importing the necessary libraries:

``` bash
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from kneed import KneeLocator
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
```
These imports include libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`), visualization (`seaborn`, `matplotlib`), clustering (KMeans from `scikit-learn`), and utilities for identifying the optimal number of clusters (`KneeLocato`r, `silhouette_score`).

## Data Generation

A synthetic dataset is generated using the `make_blobs` function from `scikit-learn`, which is useful for creating datasets suitable for clustering.

``` bash 

X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.60, random_state=0)

```

## Data Preprocessing
The generated dataset is then standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering process:

``` bash 

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

```

## Modeling
The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to the standardized data. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method and silhouette score:

- Elbow Method: The sum of squared distances (WCSS) is calculated for different numbers of clusters to identify the "elbow point".

``` bash
wcss = []
for k in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, init='k-means++', random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X_train_scaled)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)
```

- Silhouette Score: The silhouette score is calculated for different cluster counts to assess the quality of the clustering.

```bash 
silhouette_coefficients = []
for k in range(2, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, init='k-means++', random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X_train_scaled)
    score = silhouette_score(X_train_scaled, kmeans.labels_)
    silhouette_coefficients.append(score)
```

## Evaluation
The notebook evaluates the clustering results by plotting the elbow curve and silhouette scores:

- Elbow Curve: Plots the WCSS against the number of clusters to visually identify the optimal cluster count.

``` bash
plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss)
plt.xticks(range(1, 11))
plt.xlabel("Number of Clusters")
plt.ylabel("WCSS")
plt.title("Elbow Method for Optimal k")
plt.show()
```

-Silhouette Coefficients: Plots the silhouette scores to further confirm the optimal number of clusters.

```bash
plt.plot(range(2, 11), silhouette_coefficients)
plt.xticks(range(2, 11))
plt.xlabel("Number of Clusters")
plt.ylabel("Silhouette Coefficient")
plt.title("Silhouette Analysis for Optimal k")
plt.show()
```

## Visualization
The notebook includes comprehensive visualizations to aid in interpreting the clustering results. Key visualizations include:

- The Elbow Curve helps identify the optimal number of clusters by showing the point where adding more clusters no longer significantly reduces WCSS.

- The Silhouette Coefficient Plot provides a measure of how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, helping confirm the optimal clustSer count.
